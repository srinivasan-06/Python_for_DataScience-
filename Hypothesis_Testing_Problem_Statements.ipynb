        "\n",
        "1. **State the Hypotheses**\n",
        "  -  **Null Hypothesis($H_0$)**: The default assumption or claim to be tested (e.g., \"There is no difference in means\").\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Alternative Hypothesis($H_1$)**: The claim you want to test for (e.g., \"There is a difference in means\").\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Choose the Significance Level (α)**\n",
        "  - Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This is the threshold for deciding whether a result is statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Select the Appropriate Test**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Decide which statistical test suits your data and hypothesis (e.g., t-test, z-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**\n",
        "  - Use the sample data to compute the test statistic (e.g., t, z, F, or chi-square value) based on the chosen test.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Compute the p-value**\n",
        "  - The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated(assuming the null hypothesis is true).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Compare the p-value to the Significance Level**\n",
        "  - **If p-value ≤ α**: Reject the null hypothesis($H_0$). There is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **If p-value > α** : Fail to reject the null hypothesis($H_0$). There is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **State the Conclusion**\n",
        "  - Clearly state the result in the context of the problem, referencing whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not."
